Problem Statement: 

Airbnb's operations in New York City are marred by a series of interconnected challenges:

Regulatory Complexity: Struggles persist in navigating and complying with NYC's stringent regulations on short-term rentals, leading to legal conflicts and fines.

Housing Affordability Impact: Criticisms abound regarding Airbnb's role in exacerbating housing scarcity and escalating rental prices by incentivizing the conversion of residential units into short-term rentals.

Community Disruption: Residents in neighborhoods frequented by tourists voice grievances over disturbances such as noise and altered neighborhood dynamics caused by Airbnb activity.

Taxation Disputes: Contentions arise regarding Airbnb's tax obligations vis-Ã -vis traditional hotels, raising questions about revenue loss for local governments and fairness in taxation.

Safety and Compliance Concerns: Ensuring adherence to safety standards and regulatory compliance remains an ongoing challenge, with instances of illegal or unsafe listings surfacing periodically.

Objective: Addressing these complex challenges necessitates a holistic approach that considers regulatory compliance, affordability, community welfare, fair taxation, and safety standards within Airbnb's operations in New York. Additionally, we aim to determine the most prevalent room types on Airbnb in New York City, analyze the price variations among different room types, and identify the priciest regions for accommodation in New York.
